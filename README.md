# MeMaS-benchmarking

For running benchmarking, you need to first create an OpenAI API Key. This is a good [tutorial](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-use-chatgpt-api-in-python/).

Then after having a running instance of memas, run

```
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key; python3 -m benchmarking
```
